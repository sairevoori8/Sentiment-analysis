Ethical Data Analysis in Customer Behavior

This project gives the ethical analysis of customer reviews from online platforms, focusing on categorization by attributes like average rating, popularity, and product quality. Employing sentiment analysis and classification methodologies using machine learning techniques, we emphasize ethical considerations including privacy protection, bias mitigation, and algorithmic transparency. By addressing concerns about data privacy and biases, businesses can leverage customer feedback ethically to drive improvements in products and services. Through techniques like natural language processing and transparent algorithmic processes, we ensure privacy, mitigate biases, and foster trust with customers, promoting responsible data practices in the digital age.
